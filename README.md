# 👀 Demo Website

👉 Demo: https://citacoes.quackredacao.com.br/

# 💻 Technologies

This project was made using the follow technologies:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Javascript
- NotionHQ

# 🚀 Features

There are a lot of quotation websites.
But how to guarantee who wrote the sentences?
How to make sure we are giving proper credits?

This is what Quack Quotes aims to fix. Curated quotes.
Quack Quotes values quality over quantity.

This project is part of a volunteer project I manage for Brazilian students, [Quack Redação](https://quackredacao.com.br/about-us/). It was born in 2016 and we help students to get bet on writing essays.

# 🚧 How to run

```bash
# Clone Repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sheisacreative/quack-quotes.git
$ Go to folder using terminal
$ yarn (needs yarn installed)
$ yarn dev (if you wanna change something) // yarn start (just to see running)

If you want something, wait for `yarn build` to be obeyed, and after that open a little change decision!
